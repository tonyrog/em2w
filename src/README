1. How it works

Mail clients send a mail to em2w@em2w.com with a command in the
subject line on form <cmd> <site>/<page>/<item>[/<subitem>] and
the content attached or editied with HTML mail client.

The Mail will be recived and verified by the em2w, the mail is
unpacked and reconstructed to fit a web page.

The new content is then synced with the remote ftp site.


2. Main config

main configuration is found in /home/em2w/em2w.xml. 
It is in XML (em2w.dtd) format

The structure on the remote ftp site MUST be

 Ftp-Dir/<page-name>/<item-name>

It can be create manually with ftp commands or with
em2w mail commands such as (add <site>/<page> and add <site>/<page>/<item>)


3. Authentication 

In order to authenticate clients S/MIME PKCS7 format or PGP must be used.
The configuration of users that has access to update a site has the form

{EMail-Address, Site}.

  example 
        {"tony@rogvall.com", "bix"}
        {"tony@rogvall.com", "em2w"}.
	{"*", "demo"}.

or

{EMail-Address, Site, Cert | Cert-File-Name}.


4. Limits

The limitations on what content and how much that may be uploaded in 
one updated is decsribed by the command.

{Email-Address, Site, Content-List, Max-Message-Size}

{Email-Address, Site, Content, Max-Content-Size}

   example

       {"tony@rogvall.com", "bix", 
		["text/html", "text/plain", "image/*"], 32000}

       {"*", "demo", ["text/plain"], 128}

       {"*@rogvall.com", "bix", ["*/*"], all}

       {"tony@rogvall.com", "bix", "text/html", 1024}

       {"tony@rogvall.com", "bix", "image/*", 16000}
